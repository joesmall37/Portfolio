# Porfolio
## This is my personal porfolio website.
  - The website/application provides information to a potential employer with information about education and projects I have worked on.
  - The website/application contains responsive css styling in order for it to adapt to mobile and desktop screens.
  - There is a nav bottom at the top of the page in order for a developer to navigate through the website.
  - There is a contact section at the bottom of the page in order for a potential employer or developer to reach to me.
